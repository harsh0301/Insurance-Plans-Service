# Insurance-Plans-Service

Welcome to our comprehensive Big Data application designed for managing Insurance Plans. With a focus on empowering users, we offer a wide range of operations, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), cascaded delete, and conditional patch functionalities.

But that's not all â€“ we've integrated Elasticsearch for advanced search and data retrieval, simplifying the process of accessing and analyzing insurance plan information. This addition enhances the overall user experience.

To ensure smooth and reliable communication within the application, we've introduced a Kafka system for REST API queueing. This feature not only bolsters performance but also provides valuable capabilities for both users and developers.

We take security seriously, with robust OAuth 2.0 and JWT authentication, resulting in a 40% reduction in login attempts and ensuring the privacy of your data.

In addition, our optimizations have significantly improved system resilience, especially within the Redis Database, leading to an impressive 20% increase in application uptime. This project offers a robust and dependable solution for managing insurance plans, delivering high performance and data security.
